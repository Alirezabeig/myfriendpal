        🤔 Curious about what I can do? Text "Calendar 📆" to me, and with your okay, I'll keep an eye on your schedule. 🗓️ Have a big meeting or a stressful day? 😓 I've got your back. And that's not all—soon you'll be able to connect me to your Apple Watch ⌚, Fitbit 🏃‍♀️, or Gmail 📧. Whether it's health tips 🍎, sleep advice 🌙, or just a joke to make you smile 😄, I'll know when to chime in. Let's make this friendship amazing! 🌟
